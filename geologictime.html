        <h2>Geological Periods</h2>

        <p>
            Planet Earth is 4.5 billion years old, and a way to represent this deep time is with the <strong>Geologic Time Scale</strong>. which organizes Earth's history depending on any fundamental changes in stratigraphy.
            The geologic time scale is like a giant calendar for Earth's history, stretching back billions of years. It can seem complex, but here's a simplified breakdown:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li> Eons - These are the biggest slices of time, scaling to thousands of millions of years. There are four main eons: Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic (we're currently in the Phanerozoic Eon).</li>
            <li> Eras - Think of these as subdivions within the eons, which span for hundreds of millions of years. For example, the Paleozoic Era is known for the rise of marine life.</li>
            <li> Periods - These are smaller segments within the eras, and typically last for tens of millions of years. The Jurassic Period, for instance, is famous for its dinosaurs.</li>
            <li> Epochs - The second smallest segment, found within periods and tending to be between 13 to 35 million years in length. Epoch names are often "Upper", "Middle", or "Lower". For example, the Cenozoic Era contains seven epochs</li>
            <li> Ages- The smallest segment in the chronological order, these segments are usually only a few million years in length. Ages typically end with the suffix "-an"/"-ian".</li>
        </ul>

                    <p>Life was proliferating on the seas, but on land it was a different story, the sun's radiation made land an inhospitable habitat. this would change with the rising oxygen levels and the creation of the ozone layer allowing organisms to sun exposure, letting the birth to the first terrestrial plants. At the end of this period there was an ice age that led to the extinction of 85% of marine life.</p>

                    <p>During the Silurian period, fish started to diversify as they devlop new characteristics that would serve as blueprints for our evolution like jaws. Fish divided into placoderms (armoured fish), cartilaginous fish and bony fishes. Most notably, in the group of the bony fishes, the very first lobe-finned fish (ancestors of tetrapods) appeared in this period.</p>

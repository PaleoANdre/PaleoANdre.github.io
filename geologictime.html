        </div>
        <h2>Geological Periods</h2>

        <p>
            Planet Earth is 4.5 billion years old, and a way to represent this deep time is with the <strong>Geologic Time Scale</strong>. which organizes Earth's history depending on any fundamental changes in stratigraphy.
            The geologic time scale is like a giant calendar for Earth's history, stretching back billions of years. It can seem complex, but here's a simplified breakdown:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li> Eons - These are the biggest slices of time, scaling to thousands of millions of years. There are four main eons: Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic (we're currently in the Phanerozoic Eon).</li>
            <li> Eras - Think of these as subdivions within the eons, which span for hundreds of millions of years. For example, the Paleozoic Era is known for the rise of marine life.</li>
            <li> Periods - These are smaller segments within the eras, and typically last for tens of millions of years. The Jurassic Period, for instance, is famous for its dinosaurs.</li>
            <li> Epochs - The second smallest segment, found within periods and tending to be between 13 to 35 million years in length. Epoch names are often "Upper", "Middle", or "Lower". For example, the Cenozoic Era contains seven epochs</li>
            <li> Ages- The smallest segment in the chronological order, these segments are usually only a few million years in length. Ages typically end with the suffix "-an"/"-ian".</li>
        </ul>

        <div>
            <h2>The Precambrian Eon and the origin of Earth</h2>
            <div>Taking place between 4.500 million years and 544 million years ago, Earth was nothing but a glowing mass filled oceans of lava with temperatures surpassing 1000 C. One of the most important events that happened through this eon was the collision with the proto-planet known as Theia, which threw a large part of Earth's mass into space, which ended up becoming our moon. It was also during this time period that multiple elements such as water arrived in the form of millions of meteorites that cooled the surface of the planet. This time period also takes 88% of Earth's history, with it's end, being the Phanerozoic eon, the other 12% of Earth's history.

            <h2> The Phanerozoic Eon and the very first organisms</h2>
            <div>
                The Phanerozoic eon is divided into three eras: Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras. These are the most well-known eras as it is the time when life frist started to evolve into more complex shapes and structures.

            <h2>The Paleozoic Era and the first animals</h2>
            <div>
                The Paleozoic era takes place between 550 to 225 million years ago. This was in turn divided into six periods, their names relating to the places they were discovered:

                    <div>Life was proliferating on the seas, but on land it was a different story, the sun's radiation made land an inhospitable habitat. this would change with the rising oxygen levels and the creation of the ozone layer allowing organisms to sun exposure, letting the birth to the first terrestrial plants. At the end of this period there was an ice age that led to the extinction of 85% of marine life.</div>

                    <div>
                        During the Silurian period, fish started to diversify as they devlop new characteristics that would serve as blueprints for our evolution like jaws. Fish divided into placoderms (armoured fish), cartilaginous fish and bony fishes. Most notably, in the group of the bony fishes, the very first lobe-finned fish (ancestors of tetrapods) appeared in this period.

                    <div>
                        The Devonian period is also called the Age of Fishes as bony, cartilaginous and armoured fish were thriving in this time period, with some examples being Stetacanthus, Dunkleosteus, and the bizarre Tiktaalik. Invertebrates have also been experiencing a diversification, like the arthropod Jaekelopterus, while trilobites and corals were thriving, ammonites also evolve. In land, the very first trees appear alognside with seeds like gimnosperms. At the end of this period, a second mass extinction occure that killed off 80% of all species.

                    <div>
                        This period was a boom in monsters, prehistoric shark-like animals ruled the oceans, like Helicoprion. The continents were populated with giant insets such as the giant dragonfly Meganeura, 2-meter long millipedes like Arthropleura. There were also vertebrates like the amphibians, or the first reptiles, who started to become independent from the water by laying eggs on land.

                    <div>
                        Reptiles became the dominant animals during this time, the coal forests of the Carboniferous were replaced by conifers. The end of the Permian led to what is thought to be a period of extreme vulcanism, causing the biggest mass extinction the Earth ever saw, known as 'The Great Dying', killing off 90% of all life on Earth. It took vertebrates millions of years to recover.

            <div>
                The Mesozoic era took place between 250 to 66 million years ago. The name means in Greek, intermediate animal life, and it is well-known because all dinosaurs lived here. Mammals and birds appeared, and the supercontinent of Pangea started to separate here, creating a wide variety of ecosystems that gave rise to the angiosperms, or plants with fruit and coniferous forests

                    <div>
                        Archosaurs began to dominate the Earth, within this broad group, the dinosaurs, pterosaurs and early crocodilians appeared. Aquatic reptiles like the ichthyosaurs, and turtle-like Henodus lived in the seas. Cynodonts wee forced to live in burrows and hunt at night due to the fierce competition with the first dinosaurs. Dinosaurs from this time period aren't as varied or big as in later time periods.

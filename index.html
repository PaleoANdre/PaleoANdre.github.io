                <p>Planet Earth teems with life, up to 1,120,000 species of animals are known. How did these many species originate? To answer them we must turn to fossils and to a knowledge of living organisms and their structures.</p>

                    All forms of life evolved from early beginnings approximately 3.5 billion years ago. From relatively few primitive forms, the major groups of plants and animals developed. Living things became more complex and adapted to various ways of living. Paleontology traces the different paths by which plants and animals evolved to their present forms. Some species, such as elephants and horses, have undergone significant adaptations. Others, like horseshoe crabs and sharks, have remained relatively unchanged for millions of years.

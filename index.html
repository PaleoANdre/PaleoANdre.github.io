                <p>The Earth is about 4.5 billion years old, but the first signs of life first appeared back at least 3.5 billion years ago. This website looks back into one of the most exciting times in the history of life: the development of the first complex organisms. Despite the fact that most of the creatures in this website have gone extinct for millions of years before the arrival of man, these were some of the most extraordinary creatures, with some of the most savage and strange of creatures the Earth has ever seen. <strong>Check out our content:</strong></p>

                    <h3>NEW LOOK FOR THUNDER BIRDS</h3>
                    <p>An interesting new study has revised what we know about prehistoric giant birds that inhabited Australia. The members of the family Dromornithidae, also known as the "thunder Birds" were well-known for growing to huge sizes, reaching up to 3m in height and lived around 25 million years ago to up to a few thousands of years ago. This new study redefines the skull anatomy of <em>Genyornis newtoni</em>, by analyzing new fossil material. The new research shows that Genyornis had a wide jaw gape, a powerful bite and similar to that of a goose, showing adaptations for a watery habitat.</p>

    <h1>Inostrancevia: Paleo Profile</h1>
    <h2>The First Saber-toothed Tyrant</h2>
    <p>During the last million years of the Permian Period, Earth was experiencing one of the most hostile periods of time for living beings, as high vulcanism filling the atmosphere with green-house effect gases and slowly poisoning the planet and it's inhabitants. It was also during this time that the synapsids, a group of reptiles more closely related to mammals than to lizards.
        A specific group evolved to become the apex predators of Pangea, the gorgonopsids.
    </p>

    <p>Inostrancevia was a huge carnivorous therapsid which lived between 259 to 251.9 million years ago in what was known as the Late Permian and fossils have been found in Russia and South Africa.
        To the writing of his article, there are 4 recognized species of Inostrancevia.

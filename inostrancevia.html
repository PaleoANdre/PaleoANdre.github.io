    <h2>The First Saber-toothed Tyrant</h2>
    <p>During the last million years pf the Permian Period, Earth was experiencing one of the most hostile periods of time for living beings, as high vulcanism filling the atmosphere with green-house effect gases and slowly poisoning the planet and it's inhabitants. It was also during this time that the synapsids, a group of reptiles more closely related to mammals than to lizards.

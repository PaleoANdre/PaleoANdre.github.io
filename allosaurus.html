    <h1>Allosaurus: Paleo Profile</h1>
    <h2>The Jurassic's most common apex predator</h2>
    <p>For dinosaur enthusiasts, the word "Jurassic" might picture a giant theropod other than Tyrannosaurus. The Morrison Formation's apex predator, Allosaurus, a fearsome predator with a terrifying bite and unmatched speed for it's size.
        Allosaurus is the most common, and arguably one of the most well-known Jurassic predators.
    </p>
        Allosaurus was built like the typical giant theropod, having a massive skull on a short neck, a long sloping tail, and large arms with 3 sharp claws.
        <p>One of this dinosaur's most distinguished characteristics is the pair of horns above and in front of it's eyes that varied in shape and size, there were also a pair of ridges running on top of the nasal bones that led to the horns. Paleontologists have speculated that these horns were covered on keratin and could have had many uses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>These horns could block the dircet sunlight from hitting this animal's eyes.</li>
        <li>They could also be display strucutres for communication, such as attracting mates or intimidating rivals.</li>
        <li>The least plausible use of these horns would be for combat between each other, this is highly unlikely since these horns were fragile.</li>
